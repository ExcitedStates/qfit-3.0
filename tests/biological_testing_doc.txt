This is a draft area for everyone to put in PDBs that should be included in our larger biological testing script. We are aiming for 100 PDBs to be analyzed here.

Considerations for PDBs to include:
  #resolution
  #method (X-ray v. Cyro)
  #isotropic v. anisotropic
  #biologically interesting residue
  #including hydrogens
  #containing nucleotides
  #different types of proteins
  #different types of ligands
  #non-natural amino acids
  #size 
  
Please add your PDBs below with a description of what categories about it meets. For PDBs to be included in this test set, it should be run t

Potential PDBs (PDBs of interest based on criteria but HAVE NOT been vetted through qFit/manual review)

7A4M: CyroEM Apoferritin, 1.22 resolution
5CH3: X-ray, 1.71 resolution (matching old qFit structure: 5IVD) (Correy)
43PQ: X-ray, room temp, 1.35 resolution (Keedy)
7KQ0, 7KQP, 7KR0: Macrodomain apo or with ADP ribose, 0.9-1.2 resolution, different crystal forms

From Daniel:

3k5v- abl kinase
3pyy- abl kinase
1exr- cam
1osa- cam
1gwe- catalase (high res, carefuly curated and can be used as a positive control for qfit runs)
1jbe- chey
cypa- 3k0m
cypa- 3kon
cypa- 3k0o
dhfr- can be used to study any ligand protein interactions
gb3- small proteins, quick to run
hiv-protease (1kzk)- peptide flips at the active site, good test case
ptp1b- should be replaced with step structures because of backbone movements that can be captured by qfit
spa_n_c_dom- alt conf in the helix but too big for qfit to handle. qfit could mabe pickup the sidechain stuff?
ubiquitin- mostly rigid, some flexibility, can be used as a test case to see how qfit does

PDBs to include (PDBs of interest based on criteria but HAVE been vetted through qFit/manual review)
  -include PDB along with how it should be run in qFit protein 

EXAMPLE: 3KON_composite_omit_map.mtz -l 2FOFCWT,PH2FOFCWT 3K0N.pdb; CypA, resolution: 1.39, bioliocally interesting residues, RT, X-ray, anisotropic refinement
