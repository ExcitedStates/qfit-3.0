This is a draft area for everyone to put in PDBs that should be included in our larger biological testing script. We are aiming for 100 PDBs to be analyzed here.

Considerations for PDBs to include:
  #resolution
  #method (X-ray v. Cyro)
  #isotropic v. anisotropic
  #biologically interesting residue
  #including hydrogens
  #containing nucleotides
  #different types of proteins
  #different types of ligands
  #non-natural amino acids
  #size 
  
Please add your PDBs below with a description of what categories about it meets. For PDBs to be included in this test set, it should be run t

Potential PDBs (PDBs of interest based on criteria but HAVE NOT been vetted through qFit/manual review)

PDBs to include (PDBs of interest based on criteria but HAVE been vetted through qFit/manual review)
  -include PDB along with how it should be run in qFit protein 

EXAMPLE: 3KON_composite_omit_map.mtz -l 2FOFCWT,PH2FOFCWT 3K0N.pdb; CypA, resolution: 1.39, bioliocally interesting residues, RT, X-ray, anisotropic refinement
